### Two Independent Teachers are Better Role Model





This repository contains the tensorflow  of the model we proposed in our paper: Two Independent Teachers are Better Role Model

The code is available in tensorflow. To run the project kindly refer to the individual readme file.





### Dataset


iSEG 2017 dataset was chosen to substantiate our proposed method. It contains the 3D multi-modal brain MRI data of 10 labeled training subjects and 13 unlabeled testing subjects.


MRBrainS13 dataset was also used to test the robustness of our proposed model. It contains 3 modalities (T1-weighted, T1-weighted inversion recovery and FLAIR). Original Dataset consists of 5 labeled training and 6 unlabeled testing subjects. 




### Proposed model architecture


The following shows the model architecture of the proposed model. (Read our paper for further details)
