### Two Independent Teachers are Better Role Model





This repository contains the tensorflow  of the model we proposed in our paper: Two Independent Teachers are Better Role Model

The code is available in tensorflow. To run the project kindly refer to the individual readme file.





### Dataset


iSEG 2017 dataset was chosen to substantiate our proposed method. It contains the 3D multi-modal brain MRI data of 10 labeled training subjects and 13 unlabeled testing subjects.

MRBrainS13 dataset was also used to test the robustness of our proposed model. Original Dataset consists of 5 labeled training and 6 unlabeled testing subjects. 



### Since, as you might now, sharing medical data is not a good-practice, I did not include any sample in the corresponding folders. To make your experiments you must include your data in the repositories indicated in the configure.py file


### Proposed model architecture

The following shows the model architecture of the proposed model.

###   Requirements
###   Programming language

The code has been written in Python (3.6.15) and requires Tensorflow
You should also have installed
scipy,
tensorflow,
numpy
The code required  to load images in Nifti formats. And  you should install nibabel
